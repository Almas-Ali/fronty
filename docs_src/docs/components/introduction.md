# Components

## What are Components?

Components are the building blocks of your application. They are reusable UI elements that can be composed together to build a UI. Components are also the unit of encapsulation for the UI, CSS, and behavior. Components for manipulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from Python code are provided by the `fronty` package. Components are created by subclassing the `fronty.html.BaseElement` class. We will learn more about components in the customizing components section.
