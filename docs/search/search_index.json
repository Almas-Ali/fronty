Fronty does not provide a backend server. You can use any backend server you want. For example, you can use Flask. You can also use Fronty with Django. But you have to install Django first. For simplicity, we have used Flask in the example projects. We are woring on a backend server for Fronty. It will be available soon.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"installation.html","title":"Installation","text":"<p>You can easily install Fronty using pip.

You can easily create a website using. It is mainly focused on the frontend part. So, we haven't add any backend features. But, you can easily add backend features using any backend framework like Flask, Django, etc.</p> <p>But, we are working on a backend framework for fronty named Backkr. And we are also working on a database framework named Flexdb. So, you can easily create a full stack website with database using Fronty in only Python technology without knowing any kind of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p> <p>Here we will use flask as a backend framework for making this documentation short. But, you can use any backend framework you want. We will update this documentation when we release Backkr and Flexdb. So, you can easily create a full stack website using only Python.</p>"},{"location":"quick-start.html#starter-template","title":"Starter template","text":"app.py<pre><code>from flask import Flask, request\nfrom fronty.html import *\napp = Flask(__name__)\ndef home(request) -&gt; Html:\n'''This is the home page view function'''\nreturn Html(\nHead(\nTitle('Home'),\nMeta(charset='utf-8'),\nMeta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'),\n),\nBody(\nElement(\n'center',\nElement(\n'h1',\n'Welcome to Fronty!'\n),\nElement(\n'p',\n'Fronty is a frontend web framework.'\n),\n)\n)\n)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index() -&gt; str:\n'''This is the home page view function'''\nreturn home(\nrequest=request,\n).render()\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n</code></pre> <p>This is a starter template for fronty. You can use this template to create a basic website using fronty.  First, we import the Flask and request from flask. Then, we import Html, Head, Title, Meta, Body, Element from fronty.html package.  Then, we create a flask app. Then, we create a home view function. This view function will return a Html object. This Html object will contain the HTML code for the home page.  Then, we create a index view function. This view function will call the home view function and render the HTML code.  Then, we run the flask app.</p> <p>Fronty has a very simple syntax. You can easily create a website using it. It has some built-in element like Button, Link, Anchor etc. You can use these elements to create a website. You can also create your own element using the BaseElement class. We will see how to create a element in the customization section.</p>"},{"location":"blog/index.html","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"components/introduction.html","title":"Components","text":""},{"location":"components/introduction.html#what-are-components","title":"What are Components?","text":""},{"location":"components/css/customized-elements.html","title":"Customized elements","text":""},{"location":"components/css/introduction.html","title":"CSS Components","text":""},{"location":"components/css/introduction.html#what-are-css-components","title":"What are CSS Components?","text":""},{"location":"components/html/customized-elements.html","title":"Customized elements","text":""},{"location":"components/html/introduction.html","title":"HTML Components","text":""},{"location":"components/html/introduction.html#what-are-html-components","title":"What are HTML Components?","text":""},{"location":"components/js/customized-elements.html","title":"Customized elements","text":""},{"location":"components/js/introduction.html","title":"Javascript Components","text":""},{"location":"components/js/introduction.html#what-are-javascript-components","title":"What are Javascript Components?","text":""}]}
